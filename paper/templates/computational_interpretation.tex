The precise alignment of fundamental constants with the G$_2$ sedenion geometry supports the hypothesis that physical law is isomorphic to a specific computational structure, rather than merely being described by it.

\subsection{The Sedenion Instruction Set}

If we view the universe as a computational system, the Sedenion algebra represents its \textbf{Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{State Vector}: The 16-dimensional sedenion field $S(x)$ encodes the complete state of the vacuum, matter, and forces at any point.
\item \textbf{Operations}: The physical interactions (Standard Model forces) are not arbitrary laws but are the elementary arithmetic operations (multiplication, conjugation) defined by the algebra.
\item \textbf{Generators}: The 14 generators of G$_2$ act as the "valid operations" that preserve the logic of the system (automorphisms).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Associativity as Causality}

Standard quantum mechanics and matrix algebra are \textit{associative}: $(AB)C = A(BC)$. This implies a form of parallel processing where the grouping of operations does not affect the outcome.
Sedenions are \textit{non-associative}: $(AB)C \neq A(BC)$.

We propose that this mathematical property is the physical origin of \textbf{Causality} and the \textbf{Arrow of Time}.
In a non-associative system, the \textit{order of execution} is strictly binding. One cannot compute the final state without computing the intermediate steps in a specific sequence. Thus, "Time" is simply the sequential execution index of the algebraic operations.

\subsection{Space-State Equivalence}

Just as we identified Time with Entropy (sequential execution depth), we identify Space with Information (parallel state capacity).

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\text{Spatial Distance } \Delta x \equiv \text{ Information Divergence } D(S_A || S_B)}
\end{equation}

Physical distance is not a fundamental separation in a pre-existing container. Instead, two objects are "far apart" because their algebraic states have high Hamming distance or orthogonality in the Sedenion lattice. Motion is not translation through space; it is the sequential update of the state vector to reduce this divergence.

This resolves the paradox of non-locality: entanglement is simply a connection with zero information divergence, regardless of the "spatial" distance rendered by the classical observer.

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics as 'Linearized' Computation}

We demonstrated that the Sedenion algebra naturally violates the CHSH inequality with $S \approx 2.82$ (Tsirelson's bound). This suggests that what we perceive as "Quantum Weirdness" (entanglement, non-locality) is the natural behavior of a deterministic, non-associative computer seen from a linear perspective.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wavefunction}: The unexecuted data/code.
\item \textbf{Measurement/Collapse}: The execution of the algebraic operation, forcing the system to commit to a specific bracketing (outcome).
\item \textbf{Entanglement}: A state where the algebraic factors cannot be separated into independent sub-routines.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Associative Path Integral}

The Feynman Path Integral formulation posits that a particle explores all possible paths in spacetime. We reinterpret this behavior not as motion through a pre-existing container, but as the exploration of the algebraic structure itself.

In a non-associative algebra, the product of $N$ terms has Catalan number $C_{N-1}$ possible bracketings. The physical "Path Integral" corresponds to the sum over these association trees. The classical path (Least Action) corresponds to the \textbf{Associative Subspace}—the path of minimum algebraic stress.

\textbf{Implication}: Space is not a fundamental container. "Distance" is a measure of algebraic separation (number of operations required to link states). "Locality" is an emergent property of the associative sector. The universe is a single, non-local Sedenion object, and what we perceive as motion is the sequential update of its internal state.

\subsection{Computational Irreducibility}

Why G$_2$ and Sedenions? Our computational analysis demonstrates that G$_2$ is the unique algebra that satisfies the requirement of maximal symmetry within a non-associative framework. This structure is not the result of an evolutionary optimization process, but a geometric necessity. The constants of nature are computationally irreducible: they cannot be "tuned" because they are the fixed coefficients of the unique Sedenion manifold.

This framework unifies Physics (the study of matter/energy) with Computer Science (the study of information processing). These findings suggest a correspondence between physical reality and the algebraic structure of Sedenions.
