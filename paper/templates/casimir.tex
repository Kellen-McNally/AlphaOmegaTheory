Casimir operators are central invariants of Lie algebras. For G$_2$, the Casimir operators
combine with geometric data to predict physical observables.

\subsection{Casimir Operator Algebra}

G$_2$ has two independent Casimir operators:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quadratic Casimir (Dual Coxeter): $h^\vee = {{ c2 }}$
\item Effective Cubic Invariant: $Q_{eff} = {{ c3 }}$ (Sedenion Associator Winding)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Predictions from Casimir Operators}

The Casimir operators combine with G$_2$ geometric data to predict observables:

\paragraph{Dark Energy Density}
\[\Omega_\Lambda = \frac{Q_{eff}}{\dim(G_2) + \text{rank}(G_2)} = \frac{ {{ c3 }} }{ {{ dim }} + 2} = \frac{ {{ c3 }} }{16}\]

\paragraph{The Number 42}

The unification scale: $42 = \tau \times \dim(G_2) = {{ tau }} \times {{ dim }}$

\subsection{Implications for Physical Constants}

The Casimir operators provide the mathematical foundation for parameter-free
predictions of physical constants, demonstrating that G$_2$ geometry is the
mathematical structure underlying fundamental physics.
