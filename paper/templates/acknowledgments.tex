\section*{Acknowledgments}

We acknowledge \textbf{Cohl Furey} for her foundational research on the connection between octonions and particle physics. Her derivation of the $SU(3)_C$ and $U(1)_{EM}$ structures from division algebras provided the essential algebraic basis upon which this G$_2$ framework is built.

We thank \textbf{Alexander Unzicker} for his critical analysis of the Standard Model's parameter problem. His insistence on the necessity of deriving fundamental constants from first principles motivated the zero-parameter methodology adopted in this work.

We also thank the developers of the open-source scientific computing ecosystem—specifically the contributors to \texttt{NumPy}, \texttt{SciPy}, and \texttt{mpmath}—whose tools enabled the rigorous verification of these theoretical claims.
